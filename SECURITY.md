# credentialsd Security Policy

Since this project handles very sensitive data, we, the maintainers of
credentialsd, take security seriously. This policy outlines our intentions for
addressing security issues and practices for security researchers investigating
this project.

## Submitting Vulnerability Reports

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
to us privately via the process below.

We use GitHub for private vulnerability disclosure. To report a vulnerability:

1. Go to [Security > Advisories > New draft security advisory][new-advisory].
2. Fill out the report and submit the draft.
3. The maintainers will be privately notified about the advisory and get back to
   you.

[new-advisory]: https://github.com/linux-credentials/credentialsd/security/advisories/new

## Expected Response

We aim to acknowledge the receipt of the report as soon as possible and will
work with you. We seek to investigate issues within 30 days.

If the issue is confirmed upon investigation, we will collaborate with you to
remediate the vulnerability. Depending on the severity or developer
availability, we may request more time to remediate the issue before
public disclosure.

# Supported Releases

We only support the latest published release. We may backport patches when
possible to help users running on distributions that package older versions of
our software.

# Threat Model

We do not currently have a formally defined threat model; we will continue to
document it over time. However, the basic security guarantees we would like to
achieve are defined below.

Please note, that if you believe you have discovered a security problem outside
of this scope, we still want to know about it! We would still like to discuss
the issue privately, but we may decide to address it beyond the response
time described above.

## Definitions

- _privileged client_: A client that is allowed to make requests for credentials
  for any origin.
- _unprivileged client_: A client that is allowed to make requests for
  credentials for only a preconfigured set of origins.

## Scope

Here is the current list of items that are in scope:

- Privileged clients may request credentials via this service[^1] for any origin.
- The list of privileged clients cannot change without:
  - `root` privileges, or
  - user consent[^2]
- The list of unprivileged clients cannot change without:
  - `root` privileges, or
  - user consent[^2]

We implicitly trust the kernel and D-Bus, so any attacks that exploit those are
out of scope for this project.

Some other attacks that are explicitly out of scope are those that require:

- physical access
- direct access to authenticators
- root privilege escalation

[^1]:
    Various systems may allow users to interact with authenticators directly
    (e.g. allowing unrestricted permission to USB devices or Bluetooth service
    data), so those are out of scope.

[^2]:
    In the future we may offer a stricter guarantee that privileged clients
    must include permission in application metadata signed by a trusted party.
